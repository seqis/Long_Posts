# Long_Posts

Reddit's auto-filters are a mystery to me. It almost seems that thoughtful conversation is stifled because lengthy posts are just cut off at the knees and not shown publically once posted.

What Reddit seems to do in fact when you post a very long comment (or post) is it fools you into thinking it was posted to the thread and in fact as the poster, you see it right there in the thread -- but it's actually only there for you and NO ONE ELSE SEES IT.

Whenever I have checked on a lengthy post from another browser (not logged in to Reddit), sure enough -- the post was not there.

Pretty insidious if you ask me.

They should just tell me "you wrote too much, try some brevity", but no let's just fool the user into thinking it went up.

But on certain posts I have a lot to say and I'd like the chance to have my thoughts heard, since after all Reddit has become the [stoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoa) of the 21st century. So my way of circumventing this censorship is to just post a brief message in the Reddit thread and to link out to Github where I can post my full thoughts.

My apologies to anyone who find this annoying and if you're reading this, I guess you don't. But I can't think of another way to get my full throated points across in a conversation that merits proper participation.

Thanks for reading and I wish you well.
