[This is my reply to the post about creating a text based RPG in Obsidian](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1fh0ov4/hello_i_have_a_question_about_setting_up_a_map_of/)

Yes, this is definitely possible, and your idea for a **Castle of Contents** is really interesting ... I had never thought of that notion before -- to use a vault in this way.

You can make your Map of Contents feel like an interactive, text-based RPG using a few key tools in Obsidian.

⭐ _This reminds me of the old "Choose your own adventure" books I used to read as a kid. "If you choose to go left, turn to page 88, if you go right turn to page 103..." that sort of thing... great stuff...............the old ZORK games of old (and yes, I played them .................)_

Start by creating a **home note** (your foyer) where you can set up prompts, like a butler asking, _"Where can I direct you?"_. From there, you can use **[[links]]** to direct yourself to different “rooms” in your vault. These rooms could be anything you want—like **Popular Rooms**, **Newest Additions**, or a **History Tour**.

To give your Castle an interactive feel, you can write out conversational prompts directly in the note. For example, you could have:

```
```dataview
## Welcome to the Castle!
- "Where can I direct you today?"
  - [[Popular Rooms]]
  - [[Newest Additions]]
  - [[Explore the Archives]]
```

This will help simulate the text-based RPG experience, where you’re being prompted to explore different sections of your vault.

For a more **dynamic** experience, you can integrate the **Dataview plugin** to automatically pull in content like recent notes or notes that haven’t been viewed in a while. Dataview allows you to display collections of notes based on metadata or creation date, making your castle feel _alive_ with constantly updated information. You could use Dataview to generate lists under sections like “Newest Additions” or “History Tour”:

```
```dataview
table file.mtime as Last_Modified
from "YourFolder"
sort file.mtime desc
limit 10
```

The Dataview plugin allows you to query your notes based on various parameters, such as creation date, modification date, specific keywords, or metadata. This means instead of manually curating lists of notes or “rooms,” you can have Dataview automatically update and display content that changes as your vault grows. This would make the “Castle” feel alive—constantly evolving based on your recent activities and note-taking.

You can create a section in your Castle called **Popular Rooms**, where the most frequently visited or interacted-with notes are displayed. Although Dataview can't track exact "visit counts," you can manually add metadata (like a “visited” tag) to each note when you visit it, and then use Dataview to pull notes with the highest number of "visit" tags. This would create the feeling that certain rooms are more lively than others, giving you that RPG-like sense of exploration.

One of the simplest ways to create dynamic content is to set up a section of your Castle that pulls in the **most recently created or modified notes**. This could simulate new “wings” or “rooms” being added to your Castle as you write. Here’s an example query that lists the 10 most recently modified notes:

```
```dataview
table file.name as "New Room", file.mtime as "Last Modified"
from "YourFolder"
sort file.mtime desc
limit 10
```

By using Dataview, you turn your **Castle of Contents** into an adventure where rooms open up based on your activity, ideas, and discoveries. The dynamic updates make it feel as though the castle has a life of its own—constantly presenting you with new paths to explore. ***When you add new notes that fit this Dtaview query, you immediately populate the dataview window in your castle-note with the new rooms/content and the adventure would come alive***.

Whether it's uncovering forgotten ideas in the “History Tour” or seeing new “rooms” added every day in the Newest Additions section, the whole experience becomes interactive and exploratory.

⭐***The real magic would happen if you put this on a public directory like on a dropbox or google drive directory you share with others so they could mount that directory and view the vault from their own instances of Obsidian -- and play the game :)***

Imagine wandering into a new room of your Castle and seeing a list of notes from a year ago, almost like stumbling upon an old journal in a dusty library. Or you might return to your “foyer” and find new wings of the castle have appeared overnight—showing notes you've recently added or modified, just waiting to be explored.

To add a sense of **historical exploration** to your Castle, you can create a **History Tour** where older notes are showcased. You could set up a timeline of your vault, where you explore “forgotten rooms” (notes that haven’t been modified in a long time). This gives an adventure-like vibe as you revisit old memories or ideas:

```
```dataview
table file.name as "Old Room", file.ctime as "Created On"
from "YourFolder"
where file.mtime <= date(today) - dur(1 year)
sort file.ctime asc
limit 10
```

This query pulls in notes that haven’t been touched in over a year, showing you old ideas that might feel like “hidden chambers” in your Castle.

You don't need any complex scripts to make this happen. **Markdown** and **Dataview** will cover most of your needs. You can start small by creating simple links and notes, and over time, you can expand by layering in **Templater** or **Button plugins** to add clickable actions, like choosing different paths through your Castle based on button presses.

**Templater** could be used to automate certain interactions, like having the butler present you with different choices or creating new “rooms” dynamically based on what content you’ve added recently. You can keep things simple while slowly building up these interactive features as your vault grows.

With just a few tools—mainly Markdown, Dataview, and simple plugins—you can absolutely bring this to life and make it feel like an interactive RPG experience.

You could go nuts with **CSS snippet stylings** too ... but that's a whole other story.

Mainly using Dataview creatively, you don’t manually update your Castle -- instead, the castle **_builds itself_** based on the data in your vault.

This adds an extra layer of immersion, as your Obsidian setup responds dynamically to the content you create, almost like a game generating new areas for you to explore as you progress.

Good luck with this man -- sounds like a fun idea (I had fun thinking this through and replying to it) ... so I hope you end up with something you could share. If I had the time, I would probably play around and do something like this.

Thanks for sharing and asking.

Really great idea!
